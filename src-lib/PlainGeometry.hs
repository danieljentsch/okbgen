Module      : PlainGeometry
Description : Provides data types for half-plains in the plane, or, equivalently, directed lines, and an intersection function.

Stability   : experimental
Portability : Depends on LAPACK and BLAS.

This module defines the data type Line representing a lines in the plane with a direction.
Those are equivalent to half-planes.

This module uses `hmatrix` which relies on the LAPACK and BLAS libraries.  On Debian, installing the packages `liblapack-dev` and `libblas-dev` provides them.
